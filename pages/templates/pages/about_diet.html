        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet, a traditional eating pattern originating from countries bordering the Mediterranean
            Sea, has garnered widespread attention for its potential health benefits. Characterized by high consumption
            of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, fish, and moderate amounts of dairy and wine, this diet has
            been extensively studied for its positive effects on cardiovascular health, weight management, and overall
            longevity. This article provides a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence supporting the
            Mediterranean diet, focusing on its key components and associated health benefits.</p>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is often described as a model for healthy eating. Its origins trace back to
            the traditional dietary patterns of countries such as Greece, Italy, and Spain, and it has become a global
            symbol of healthy living. The MedDiet is characterized by a high intake of plant-based foods, healthy fats,
            lean protein sources, and moderate alcohol consumption, particularly red wine. Research into the health
            benefits of the Mediterranean diet has expanded over the last few decades, with a growing body of evidence
            suggesting it plays a significant role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular
            disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and cognitive decline.</p>

    <!-- Key Components Section -->
    <section>
        <h3>Key Components of the Mediterranean Diet</h3>

        <h5>1. Fruits and Vegetables</h5>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet emphasizes the consumption of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, typically as
            the main source of carbohydrates. These foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, which
            are believed to contribute to reducing inflammation and oxidative stress—key factors involved in the
            development of chronic diseases. Studies have shown that higher fruit and vegetable intake is linked to a
            reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, and stroke (Boeing et al., 2012).</p>

        <h5>2. Healthy Fats (Olive Oil)</h5>
        <p>Olive oil is the primary source of fat in the Mediterranean diet and is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids
            (MUFA), particularly oleic acid, which has been shown to improve heart health by reducing LDL cholesterol
            levels (Estruch et al., 2013). Olive oil also contains polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory properties.
            The Mediterranean diet’s reliance on olive oil, rather than animal fats or processed oils, has been
            consistently associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease and lower mortality rates.</p>

        <h5>3. Whole Grains</h5>
        <p>Whole grains are a staple in the Mediterranean diet, including foods such as whole wheat, barley, quinoa, and
            brown rice. These grains are high in fiber, which contributes to improved digestion, reduced blood sugar
            levels, and better weight management. The consumption of whole grains is linked to a lower risk of chronic
            diseases, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes (Slavin, 2003).</p>

        <h5>4. Fish and Lean Proteins</h5>
        <p>Fish, particularly fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines, are rich sources of omega-3 fatty acids,
            which have been shown to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease (Mozaffarian &
            Rimm, 2006). The Mediterranean diet also includes moderate amounts of poultry and dairy, particularly
            fermented dairy products like yogurt and cheese, which provide protein, calcium, and probiotics beneficial
            for gut health.</p>

        <h5>5. Legumes and Nuts</h5>
        <p>Legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas) and nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios) are integral to the Mediterranean
            diet, providing plant-based protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Regular consumption of legumes has been linked
            to improved cardiovascular health, better blood sugar control, and a reduced risk of obesity (Micha et al.,
            2017). Nuts, while calorie-dense, are associated with lower body weight and a decreased risk of chronic
            diseases when consumed in moderation.</p>

        <h5>6. Herbs and Spices</h5>
        <p>Unlike many Western diets that rely heavily on salt, the Mediterranean diet emphasizes the use of herbs and
            spices like garlic, basil, oregano, and rosemary to add flavor to dishes. This approach not only reduces
            sodium intake, which can contribute to high blood pressure, but also provides a wealth of bioactive
            compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Ryu et al., 2016).</p>

        <h5>7. Moderate Wine Consumption</h5>
        <p>Moderate consumption of red wine is a hallmark of the Mediterranean diet, particularly during meals. The
            polyphenols in red wine, especially resveratrol, have been shown to have antioxidant effects, improve
            cardiovascular health, and reduce inflammation (Rimm et al., 1999). However, it is important to note that
            the potential benefits of alcohol are only observed with moderate consumption, typically defined as one
            glass per day for women and two glasses per day for men.</p>

    <!-- Health Benefits Section -->
    <section>
        <h3>Health Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet</h3>

        <h5>1. Cardiovascular Health</h5>
        <p>One of the most extensively studied benefits of the Mediterranean diet is its effect on cardiovascular
            health. Numerous randomized controlled trials, such as the PREDIMED study, have demonstrated that adherence
            to the Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular events
            (Estruch et al., 2013). The diet’s emphasis on healthy fats, particularly olive oil and omega-3-rich fish,
            plays a key role in improving lipid profiles, reducing inflammation, and preventing arterial plaque buildup.
        </p>

        <h5>2. Weight Management</h5>
        <p>While the Mediterranean diet is not specifically designed for weight loss, its focus on whole foods, healthy
            fats, and lean proteins can help with weight management. Studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet is
            associated with a lower risk of obesity and improved weight control, as it helps reduce overall calorie
            intake by promoting satiety and balanced blood sugar levels (Harris et al., 2015).</p>

        <h5>3. Type 2 Diabetes</h5>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and lower the risk of developing type 2
            diabetes. Its high fiber content, derived from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, helps regulate
            blood glucose levels. Additionally, the diet’s emphasis on healthy fats and moderate protein intake supports
            stable insulin levels, contributing to improved glycemic control in those at risk (Salas-Salvadó et al.,
            2011).</p>

        <h5>4. Cognitive Function and Longevity</h5>
        <p>Emerging research suggests that the Mediterranean diet may also protect against cognitive decline and
            age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s. The diet’s high content of antioxidants, healthy fats, and omega-3
            fatty acids supports brain health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, which are linked to
            neurodegeneration. Studies have indicated that individuals who adhere to the Mediterranean diet experience
            slower cognitive decline and a lower risk of dementia (Scarmeas et al., 2006).</p>

        <h5>5. Cancer Prevention</h5>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet has also been linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers, including breast,
            colorectal, and prostate cancer. The diet’s high antioxidant content, derived from fruits, vegetables,
            legumes, and olive oil, helps neutralize free radicals and prevent DNA damage that could lead to cancer cell
            formation (Bosetti et al., 2004).</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The Mediterranean diet is a scientifically supported, nutrient-rich eating pattern that offers a wide range
            of health benefits. Its emphasis on plant-based foods, healthy fats, lean proteins, and moderation makes it
            a sustainable and balanced approach to nutrition. With consistent evidence showing its positive effects on
            cardiovascular health, weight management, diabetes prevention, and longevity, the Mediterranean diet remains
            one of the most well-researched and widely recommended dietary patterns in the world.</p>
